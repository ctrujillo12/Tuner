This project uses I2S to communicate from MCU to microphone.

I2S is a continuous serial data stream while active â€” bits flow one after another in sync with the bit clock.

Bit Clock (BCK) pulses for each bit.

WS flips once per sample to indicate Left or Right channel.

DATA carries bits of the audio sample matching the current WS.

Right and left channels indicate like spatialized sound as is present in headphones
